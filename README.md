## 🛠️ Classes and OOP Principles  
The project utilizes the following classes to demonstrate **Object-Oriented Programming** concepts:  

### 📂 Classes  
- **👤 Registration Class**: Handles user sign-ups.  
- **🔑 Login Class**: Manages user authentication.  
- **📚 Book Class**: Represents book attributes .  
- **📦 Orders Class**: Processes and tracks customer orders.  
- **💰 Payments Class**: Manages transactions.  
- **🗨️ Feedback Class**: Captures and stores user feedback.  

### 🧩 OOP Principles  
1. **🔗 Inheritance**:  
   - Classes extend or implement shared functionality (e.g., `Orders` extends `Payments`).  
2. **♻️ Polymorphism**:  
   - Method overloading and overriding in classes like `Book` and `Orders`.  
3. **🕵️‍♂️ Abstraction**:  
   - Use of abstract classes and interfaces to define common behavior.  
4. **🔒 Encapsulation**:  
   - Controlled access to data using private fields and getters/setters.
